I feel they are not necessary I see no harm in having them(but please add a little more context to it as in what was actually happening while it was found that the cluster was un-managed. We probably need to do this in most other places as well in monitoring.) but I would like to see if this is a possibility from any path and disable its possibility in that path(except you know the only corner case that the summary calculation was triggered but the cluster was un-managed while the calculation was underway).",
