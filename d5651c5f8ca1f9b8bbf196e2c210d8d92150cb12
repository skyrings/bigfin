      "message": "Regarding task marked as failed if all OSD additions failed, actually I feel a cluster is valid if mons are added successfully. Even if all the OSD additions failed, we can mark the task completed successfully with ADD OSD step marked a partially failed with list of failed OSDs. \n\nThis way we can make sure, user cleans the OSDs again and expand the cluster using these OSDs later.\n\nWhat you say??",
